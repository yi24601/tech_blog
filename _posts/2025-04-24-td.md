title: "The equivalence between TD(λ) backward view and forward view"

I've been studying Reinforcement Learning recently and found it difficult to track down a proof showing the equivalence between the forward and backward views of TD(λ), especially in relation to eligibility traces.
So I decided to work through the derivation myself. In this post, I share my own derivation of the equivalence between these two perspectives, in case it helps others trying to understand the connection between the two perspectives
